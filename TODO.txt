General:
    Put PIXI initialization into its own file, call methods from main. (done, kinda. Moved most logic to game.js into better-structured functions)
        Keyboard, Canvas initialization in its own class/file (game.js) (game.js now has all game logic)
    Separate simulation and rendering. Create separate ticker for simulation. (done, but ticker didn't work so I had to use setInterval)
    Make input system work with simulation, do not update anything outside of sim ticks.
        "Play" logic in simulation ticker.
    Use pseudo-header layout for files. (see ParticleDynamics.js)
        For publicly accessible stuff (effects/animations), autocompletion, not publicly accessible stuff starts with "_"
    Add UI Controls for debug features and FPS/TPS stuff.

Particle Dynamics:
    DONE

Path Interpolation:
    Vortex/enemies follow path interpolation.

Voronoi Fracture:
    Maybe optimize, maybe slap the expensive fracturing and cell processing into a web worker.

Motion Blur:


Gameplay:


Polish:
    Improve look of side panel with CSS magic.
