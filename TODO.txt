General:
    Put PIXI initialization into its own file, call methods form main.
    Separate simulation and rendering. Create separate ticker for simulation.
    Make input system work with simulation, do not update anything outside of sim ticks.
    Use pseudo-header layout for files. (see ParticleDynamics.js)
