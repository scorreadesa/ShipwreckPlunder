General:
    Put PIXI initialization into its own file, call methods from main.
        Keyboard, Canvas initialization in its own class/file (game.js)
    Separate simulation and rendering. Create separate ticker for simulation.
    Make input system work with simulation, do not update anything outside of sim ticks.
        "Play" logic in simulation ticker.
    Use pseudo-header layout for files. (see ParticleDynamics.js)
        For publicly accessible stuff (effects/animations), autocompletion, not publicly accessible stuff starts with "_"
